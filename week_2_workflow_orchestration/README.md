## Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

> If you're looking for Airflow videos from the 2022 edition,
> check the [2022 cohort folder](../cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/).

Python code from videos is linked [below](#code-repository).

Also, if you find the commands too small to view in Kalise's videos, here's the [transcript with code for the second Prefect video](https://github.com/discdiver/prefect-zoomcamp/tree/main/flows/01_start) and the [fifth Prefect video](https://github.com/discdiver/prefect-zoomcamp/tree/main/flows/01_start).
